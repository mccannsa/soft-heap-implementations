# Soft Heap Implementations
This repository contains several implementations of a modified version of the soft heap data structure described in [Soft Heaps Simplified](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/120880185). This modified version limits the total number of corrupted items to be less than or equal to $\varepsilon n$. A complete account of this modification will be provided soon.

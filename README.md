# Soft Heap Implementations
This repository contains several implementations of a modified version of the soft heap data structure described in [Soft Heaps Simplified](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/120880185). This simple modification limits the total number corrupted of items to be strictly less than or equal to $\varepsilon n$. You can read more about this modification here --> [LINK COMING SOON].
